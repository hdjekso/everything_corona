				<h2 class="section-header-left header-small">1. Microwaving your mail kills COVID-19: FALSE</h2>
				<img src="images/mail.jpg" class="about-image" width="500px" height="250px">
				<p>There have been no cases of anybody getting the virus from the mail as of May 2020. Before your mail ever
					reaches your house, it goes through several days of delivery and processing. By the time the mail
					arrives at
					your doorstep, the virus will have died already. Furthermore, microwaves were built to heat up food and
					beverages by interacting with the water molecules within, and simply won't heat up something like paper.
					Lastly, there are no set
					standards for using microwaves to disinfect objects.</p>

				<h2 class="section-header-left header-small">2. Antibodies in breastmilk can prevent/ cure COVID-19 in adults: FALSE</h2>
				<img src="images/breastmilk.jpg" class="about-image" width="500px" height="250px">
				<p>While some people claim that breast milk has immune-boosting properties, many doctors have
					debunked this myth, stating that drinking breast milk provides no health benefits to adults and may even
					lead to various illnesses. Similarly, breast milk does not contain COVID-19 antibodies. Dr. Dyan Hes, a pediatrician
					with NY City's Gramercy Pediatrics, stated that "There's no proof that breast milk at all can cure COVID or
					give you antibodies".</p>

				<h2 class="section-header-left header-small">3. COVID-19 is just as deadly/ less deadly than the flu: FALSE</h2>
				<img src="images/flu.jpg" class="about-image" height="300px">
				<p>While COVID-19 is less deadly than SARS, disease experts have agreed that the virus is
				significantly more lethal than seasonal flu. Research so far indicates that COVID-19 spreads more easily and
				has a higher death rate than the flu. The death rate from seasonal flu is around 0.1% in the US, while nearly 6%
				have died among reported COVID-19 cases in the US as of May 2020. Researchers from Columbia University recently estimated
				that only 1 in 12 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. are documented, which they said would translate to an infection
				fatality rate of about 0.6%, according to The Washington Post. Furthermore, unlike the flu, there is
				currently no vaccine for COVID-19, which theoretically makes everyone susceptible to it. According to the CDC, the flu
				affects 8% of the US population every year. In comparison, a study published March 30 in the journal 'The
				Lancet' estimates that between 50% and 80% of the population could be infected with COVID-19.</p>

				<h2 class="section-header-left header-small">4. Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) can cure COVID-19: FALSE</h2>
				<img src="https://www.fda.gov/files/MMS%3DBleach-CU-ART-06.jpg" class="about-image" height="300px">
				<p>Miracle Mineral Solution does not cure COVID-19 and has not been approved by the FDA for any use. The solution, when mixed as directed, forms industrial bleach that may cause serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.</p>
